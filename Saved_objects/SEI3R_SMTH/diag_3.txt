Checking sampler transitions treedepth.
11 of 8000 (0.14%) transitions hit the maximum treedepth limit of 10, or 2^10 leapfrog steps.
Trajectories that are prematurely terminated due to this limit will result in slow exploration.
For optimal performance, increase this limit.

Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
No divergent transitions found.

Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
E-BFMI satisfactory.

Effective sample size satisfactory.

Split R-hat values satisfactory all parameters.

Processing complete.
